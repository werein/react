## Running
Application has very few dependencies, so it’s most probably very easy to understand when you scan through the code, but there is at least few steps you should know

### Start front-end React application
Application is divided into two parts. One is pure React front-end, powered by `webpack-dev-server` in development mode.

To start this application run command bellow and open your app on `http://localhost:8080`

```javascript
npm start
```

To test your application, run

* `npm run test` - single run - good for CI or precook
* `npm run test:watch` - watches for changes, good for development

If you don’t plan to connect to your own backend, you should be just fine

### Start Express  back-end
Second part of this application is back end written in Express. This is a place, where you provide API for front-end or/and server yours production application.

To start backend server, run npm command bellow and open `http://localhost:8181`

```javascript
npm run server
```
This is also watching for changes, so when you update some code on backend, you don’t have to restart the server, it does that automatically

__Every call which goes to `/api` is proxied to this backend__ so for example when you make a request to `/api/locales` on front-end, it will go to this express backend server using the same path

## Production

Running `npm run build` will create production ready application into your `dist` folder. All you need to do is make this `dist` folder publicly available. You can use `surge.sh` as described bellow to do so.

Included Express server is preconfigured to serve `/dist` folder. All you need to do is run `npm run server` on your production server. The same is happening automatically, when you deploy to Heroku (It executes this command from `Procfile`

This is also good to run on your local computer to ensure, that your application is running as it should.

_Current production size is 208kb and 57kb gziped_

## Deployment

### Surge.sh

Simple, single-command web publishing. Publish HTML, CSS, and JS for free, without leaving the command line.

  * Don't forge to install Surge `npm i surge -g`
  * Run deployment command - `npm run surge`


### Heroku

Heroku works out of the box, just use "deploy to heroku" button
